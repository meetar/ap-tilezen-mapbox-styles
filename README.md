# ap-tilezen-mapbox-styles
Three mapbox styles for tilezen/mapzen vector tile format. The styles are made for mapbox style spec version 8 and tested in mapbox GL JS v0.44.1. 
Uses maki icon set for most sprites. 

[Demo here](https://meetar.github.io/ap-tilezen-mapbox-styles/demo/demo.html)  

There are two ways to use these styles
- just grab the style's json file directley and string replace the template parameters <sub><sup> (ie {tile_server_xyz_url}, {localization_name}, {resource_url})</sup></sub>
- use the StyleFactory class which will setup the style for you with your settings (Usage below) <sub><sup>[todo npm publish package]</sup></sub> 

### Usage
```javascript
import {StyleFactory, APOLLO_BRIGHT_STYLE, ZEN_STYLE, TONER_STYLE} from "@apollomapping/ap-tilezen-mapbox-styles";

const styleFactory = new StyleFactory({
    tileUrl: "https://your-vector-server.com/all/{z}/{x}/{y}.mvt",
    // resource url is the base location for your style's sprites and fonts    
    // you can use our public sprite and font stack whose url is below
    resourceUrl: "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/osm-vector-tiles-apollomapping",
    // localization type to use for certain labels. Pass in ISO 639-1 two-letter language code 
    // ie "en" which turns {name} into {name:en} and defaults to {name} if nothing is passed in.
    // Only used for major and minor city, country, region, ocean and sea labels.
    localization: "en"
});

const myMapBoxStyle = styleFactory.createStyle(APOLLO_BRIGHT_STYLE);
```

##### Zen Style 
A continuation of the color scheme started by mapzen in the style [here](https://github.com/mapzen/mapboxgl-vector-tiles).
The Zen style is meant to be a tad more on the minimalistic than the Apollo style.

##### Toner Style 
Toner is designed to mostly look like Stamen's minimalistic black and white "Toner" style.

Stamen's Toner repository can be found [here](https://github.com/citytracking/toner).

### Deploying and generating sprites
#### Note nvm with node 8.9 must be installed to run the sprite generation script
<sub><sup>[you can use Apollo Mapping's public sprite and fontstack resources if you do not want to do this or font generation.
 URLs are in the javascript example above]</sup></sub>  
 
8.9 is required for spritezero no other version will work not 9.x not 8.6
 
Sprites can be regenerated with the generate-sprites.sh bash script. It reads from the style .csv files that contain pairs of
icon names and the color to colorize the icon too.

Upload the contents of the sprites folder to a static site at this location: {your_resource_url}/sprites/

You can also use the simple deploy.sh script that you pass in your bucket name as first argument and aws profile name as second


### Deploying and generating glyphs/fonts
Use this openmaptiles fonts fork https://github.com/m-abboud/fonts
Run the generate.js script followed by the concat.js script which concats all fonts with their noto equivelents. If you do not
concat fonts together passing in arrays of font names does not work. A better way might be to have a server that concats them
on demand but there's really only so many combinations that make sense, merging Open Sans and Roboto doesn't make sense we really
only need to merge fonts for unicode characters not in the base font and noto includes all of them.

Then upload the generated fonts to your static web server at this location: {your_resource_url}/tile_fonts/

### Shield Icons
The shield icons come from https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Custom_Highway_Shields with slight modifications.

The license notices for the icons from the wiki state that they are in the public domain
